# Title:  Information Visualization Project 1
# Name:   Kavleen Kaur
# Output: html_notebook and R notebook

## The project focuses on mapping the whiskey distillery dataset to our best of abilities. This project helps us to find few answers based on visualization. Visualization of any dataset helps us understand the dataset better and also help us answer some of he questions better. Thus, this dataset is also visualized in order to fully understand the dataset. 


## But due to many reasons, this visualizatin is limited. We will also discuss the limitation of this visualization and also critique the visualization to best of our capabilities and thus this project will involve all the aspects of visualization.

# Visualization 2



## Using leaflet, to produce a basic map with very less interaction. Here in this map, we can zoom in order to see any distillery's location clearly with the help of markers. 


```{r}
whiskey_db<-cbind(whisky.map,whiskey$Body,whiskey$Sweetness,whiskey$Smoky,whiskey$Medicinal,whiskey$Tobacco,whiskey$Honey,whiskey$Spicy,whiskey$Winey,whiskey$Nutty,whiskey$Malty,whiskey$Fruity,whiskey$Floral,whiskey$Postcode)
```
```{r}
library(leaflet)
library(dplyr)
map<-leaflet()%>%
  addTiles()%>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$OpenStreetMap)%>%
  addMarkers(lng=UK.map$long,lat=UK.map$lat)
map
```


# Visualization 3



## Here in this map, we can zoom in order to see any distillery's location clearly through the marker but also know the distilleries information by clicking on the specific marker of any distillery. Thus, the map's effectiveness is increased by increasing the interaction of the map with its audience. The image below show the interaction level of the map under visualization 3

## Here in this map, we can zoom in order to see any distillery's location clearly through the marker but also know the distilleries information by clicking on the specific marker of any distillery. Here, the map's effectiveness is increased by adding customized markers that connects the map with audience with its presentation as to showcasing exactly what the map represents ( Location of distilleries).

## Here in this map, we can zoom in order to see any distillery's location clearly through the marker but also know the distilleries information by clicking on the specific marker of any distillery. Here, the map's effectiveness is increased by adding customized markers that connects the map with audience with its presentation as to showcasing exactly what the map represents ( Location of distilleries) but also the marker has been changed in this one because of the mess that marker was making. Also, this visualization has been made better by <b>adding setView</b> so that the view should look not messier and also pleasing to the eyes.

## Here in this map, we can zoom in order to see any distillery's location clearly through the marker but also know the distilleries information by clicking on the specific marker of any distillery. Here, the map's effectiveness is increased by adding by <b>adding setView</b> and also a <b> MINI MAP</b>  which hepls us to easily find where are we currently, at what location of the country are we at. It increases the interaction of the map and makes the interaction for the audience easier.Thus, the view should look not messier and also can be interacted effectively through the Mini map.

## Here in this map, in order to avoid the mess in the graph, we have added clusters of distilleries using the <b>cluster option</b> which are near to each other.The clusters are interctive and when are pressed, the show indivisual distillery which carries their indivisual information. Here, the map's effectiveness is increased by adding by <b> interactive clusters</b>  makes the map less messier and as they are interactive too, the audience can easily open them up for more information. It aslo helps us to understand which distilleries are in the vicinity of each other.<b> THE CLUSTERS CAN BE EXPANDED BY CLICKING ON THEM.</b>

## <b> Rest all the other features, could be produced the same way.</b>

# Analysis done:

##
1) Based on location:
    
The intended visualization was much effective as apart from just knowing the location, we inteded to increase the interactivity of the map by adding waterfall plot that could help compare nearby distilleries by clicking on the clustered markers but it could be only achieved through shiny. For, the current visualization, from a user's perspective, it was crucial to know where the distilleries were located and the best way that could be achieved was through a map. The map also shows the distilleries information which would be very useful when once know the location of the distillery.

2) Based on all features.

Features of the distilleries could be compared with shiny by creating an onclick event thrugh shiny and producing a bubble chart or radar plot but here, in this visualization, we have focused on based on features, if a user wants to know the place of the distillery, could know it through a map. The coloured markers are associated with the fetaure type and offcouse the markers contain other information as well.

# Limitation:

1)  The analysis could have more grapghs like radar plot, waterfall plot and bubble graph to draw comparisons between the distilleries in the vicinity but it could require to use shiny along with leaflet as alone leaflet does not have on click feature. Thus, restricted us to the work produced.

# Scope:

1) Use shiny to add onclick graphs and then this visualization could be a lot better.
2) Shiny could also be used for making better looking dashboards.

##

# Critiquing the map produced.

The map contains a proper view set through SetView that produces the desired zoomed view, the provider is selected keeping in mind proper display of the map. To avoid clustering clusterOption is used. LayerControl and Mini Maps also added for the right reason. Interactivity through a map is produced to the maximum limit but the map does not have the desired legend table. The legends produced are not at all effective.
